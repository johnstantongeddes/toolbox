toolbox
=======

Random useful scripts. Most of these are copied and modified from others. I try to provide attribution for each script.

**system_scripts**   

These are scripts that I have symbolically linked in my `usr/local/bin` directory 
  
    ln -s ~/toolbox/script /usr/local/bin/script
  
so they are globally available. 

**R_scripts**       

R example scripts that I've found generally useful. Named by the package or trick they demonstrate.

**tex**             

LaTex templates and style files.
